# Accurate Inference for Adaptive Linear Models

This repository provides code to reproduce simulations from [Accurate Inference for Adaptive Linear Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06695) by Yash Deshpande, Lester Mackey, Vasilis Syrgkanis, Matt Taddy. An earlier version of this paper was published at ICML 2018.
It implements the *W*-estimation procedure of the paper and validates in two synthetic data scenarios: autoregressive time
series modeling and multi-armed bandits.

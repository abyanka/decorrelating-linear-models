# Accurate Inference for Adaptive Linear Models

This repository provides code to reproduce simulations from 'Accurate Inference for Adaptive Linear Models' (ICML 2018) by Yash Deshpande, Lester Mackey, Vasilis Syrgkanis, Matt Taddy. 
It implements the *W*-estimation procedure of the paper and validates in two synthetic data scenarios: autoregressive time
series modeling and multi-armed bandits.
